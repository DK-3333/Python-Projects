# Python-Projects
Different python projects which signifies the application of python in real world.

1.**Auto Birthday Wisher** : An automatic birthday wisher Python project is a program that sends birthday wishes to individuals whose birthday is listed in a excel or a text file. The program uses the current date to compare with the dates in the excel file and sends a personalized birthday message to the individual(s) whose birthday is today. The program uses various libraries such as datetime, smtplib, and email to send the emails automatically. It also allows the user to customize the message that is sent to the recipient.

2.**Binod Detector** : The Binod Detector is a simple Python project that aims to detect the presence of the word "Binod" in text files within a given directory. The project utilizes basic file handling techniques and string manipulation to search for the word "Binod" in all text files present in the specified directory. The project is designed to demonstrate the implementation of simple file handling and string manipulation concepts in Python programming.

3.**Drinking Water Reminder** : The Drink Water Notification Reminder project is a simple yet useful application developed using Python. It aims to remind users to drink water at regular intervals throughout the day. The project involves the use of several libraries, including plyer and datetime, to display notifications and keep track of the time. With the increasing awareness of the importance of hydration for our health, this project can serve as a helpful tool to encourage people to stay hydrated and maintain a healthy lifestyle.

4.**Space Invaders** : This is an alien shooter game developed using the Pygame library. The objective of the game is to shoot down the aliens in order to score points. The player must avoid the aliens reaching their layer, as this will result in the player's death and the end of the game. The primary goal is to score the highest number of points before the game is over. The game utilizes the Math library to perform mathematical calculations and Pygame library for multimedia functions like video games. Additionally, sound effects are provided to the game through mixer library in Pygame.

5.**Bodmas** : It is a game that generates random arithmetic expressions for the user to solve. In each round, the user is asked to enter a number of integers, and then the program randomly selects arithmetic operators to form an expression. The user has to compute the result of the expression and enter it. The program checks if the user's answer is correct and awards a point for a correct answer. The game ends after 5 rounds. The code also includes some functions to handle the computations and printing the arithmetic expressions.

6.**Currency Converter System** : This program allows you to convert Indian Rupees (INR) to six different currencies: DOLLAR, DIHRAM, YUAN, BAHT, POUNDS, and SINGAPORE DOLLAR. Simply input the amount you want to convert and select the currency you want to convert to. The program will then provide you with the converted value. This program aims to provide a quick and easy way to convert currency for anyone who needs it.

7.**Flappy Birds** : This project is a simple game called "Birds and Balls" created using the Python programming language and the Turtle graphics library. The goal of the game is to control a bird's movement and avoid colliding with black balls that move across the screen from right to left. The game ends when the bird collides with a ball or flies off the screen. The player can control the bird's movement by tapping on the screen to make it fly up. This project uses vector graphics and random number generation to create a dynamic and interactive game.

8.**Password Secure** : This program generates a secure password by combining user input with random characters from the lowercase alphabet, uppercase alphabet, digits, and punctuation marks. The user inputs the desired length of the password and a string containing a placeholder for each character in the password. The program replaces specific characters in the input string with randomly generated characters to create a secure password. The output displays the final password and the replacements made in the input string.

9.**Password Generator** : This program generates a random password of a given length using a combination of lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, and punctuation symbols. The user is prompted to enter the desired length of the password, and the script validates the input before generating and printing the password. The script uses the "string" and "random" modules for generating the password.

10.**Receipt Generator** : This is a python program that allows the user to add a stream of numbers until they choose to stop. The program will keep asking the user to input the price of an item, which will be added to the running total. The user can continue adding items until they press the "q" key to quit. Once the user decides to quit, the program will display the total bill amount and a summary of all the items that were added to the bill.

11.**Tic Tac Toe** : This code implements the minimax algorithm to create an unbeatable Tic Tac Toe game. The "ai_turn()" function uses the minimax algorithm to determine the best move for the computer player. The algorithm works by evaluating all possible future moves and choosing the move that results in the best outcome for the computer.

  Here's how the function works:
1. It calls the `minimax()` function with the current state of the board, a depth of 0, and the computer player as the current player.
2. The `minimax()` function evaluates all possible moves for the current player at the current depth level. If the depth level is 0 or the game is over, it returns the score of the current state. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with the updated state, depth level, and the opposite player.
3. The `minimax()` function returns a list with the best row, column, and score for the current player at the current depth level.
4. The `ai_turn()` function uses the best row and column values to make the computer's move on the board.

12.**Fizzbuzz** : Welcome to our number guessing game! This is a simple yet exciting game where you get to guess a randomly generated number between 1 to 100. You will have 10 chances to guess the correct number, and with each incorrect guess, you will be given a clue to help you narrow down your choices. If you run out of chances, don't worry, you can always try again. Are you ready to put your guessing skills to the test? Let's play!
